# Skeletoni CSS

Skeletoni is based on the great [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com) boilerplate. Skeletoni was created in 2025 mostly for industrial aplications which require fast development, readability, touch control, responsive layout and light/dark
mode but not animations or fancy features.

Skeletoni CSS is single file with less than 1000 lines. For more complex but still simple alternative see [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/docs/classless).

**[See test webpage here](https://rysavy-dudrtools.github.io/skeletoni_css/test.html)** or download skeletoni.css and test.html from [Github](https://github.com/rysavy-dudrtools/skeletoni_css/tree/main) to see all it does. Below are some screenshots from test.html:
